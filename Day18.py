# Bug - Fixing Exercise 1
# The following get_maximum function is designed
# to return the maximum value of
# the Celsius list, while the last two lines of the code will convert
# the Celsius value to Fahrenheit and print it out.

def get_maximum():
    celsius = [14, 15.1, 12.3]
    maximum = max(celsius)
    return maximum

celsius = get_maximum()
fahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32

print(fahrenheit)

# However, when running
# the code, the following error is generated:
#
# TypeError: unsupported operand
# type(s)
# for *: 'NoneType' and 'float'
#
# Try to fix the problem so that the last two
# lines can correctly get the maximal Celsius value
# from the function definition and convert that value to Fahrenheit.
