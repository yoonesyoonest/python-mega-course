Bug-Fixing Exercise 1: The program below intends to find out how many items have at least one underscore ("_") character in them.  However, there is an error with the code. Try to find and fix it.

ids = ["XF345_89", "XER76849", "XA454_55"]

x = 0

for id in ids:

if '_' in id:
    x = x + 1
print(x)

Solution



Bug-Fixing Exercise 2: This program also intends to find out how many items have an underscore in them. However, the program has a bug. It doesn't return an error message, but it returns:

1

1

2

Instead, the expected output is:

2

Try to fix the program so it returns the expected output. Here is the buggy program:

ids = ["XF345_89", "XER76849", "XA454_55"]

x = 0

for id in ids:
    if '_' in id:
        x = x + 1
    print(x)

Solution



Bug-Fixing Exercise 3: Fix the program below so it prints out "OK" when the perimeter is less than 14 and the area is less than 8.

length = float(input("Enter length: "))

width = float(input("Enter width: "))



perimeter = (length + width) * 2

area = length * width



print("Perimeter is", perimeter)

print("Area is", area)



if perimeter < 14 and area > 10:
    print("OK")
else:
    print("NOT OK")
