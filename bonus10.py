# Bug-Fixing Exercise 1
# Alina has created a speed calculation function.
# She traveled a total of 200 miles today which took her two hours.
# She wants to use her function to calculate the average speed.

def speed(distance, time):
    return distance / time


print(speed(200, 4))
#
# However,when she calls the function (as you see below),
# she gets an error:
#
# TypeError: speed() missing 1 required positional argument: 'time'
# Try fixing the code so she gets 50 as output.


# Bug-Fixing Exercise 2 This time,
# Alina traveled 300 miles and it took her 5 hours.
# However, she is not getting the correct output from its function.
# Try fixing the code:a
#
#
def speed(distance, time):
    return distance / time


print(speed(300, 5))
